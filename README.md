## Dependencies

While libcosmic is written entirely in Rust, some of its dependencies may require shared system library headers to be installed. On Pop!_OS, the following dependencies are all that's necessary compile a typical COSMIC project:

```sh
sudo apt install cargo cmake just libexpat1-dev libfontconfig-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbcommon-dev pkgconf
```

## Examples

Some examples are included in the [examples](./examples) directory to to kickstart your
COSMIC adventure. To run them, you need to clone the repository with the following commands:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic
cd libcosmic
```

If you have already cloned the repository, run these to sync with the latest updates:

```sh
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
```

The examples may then be run by their cargo project names, such as `just run application`.
